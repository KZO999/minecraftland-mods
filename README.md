### Essential First Steps

Before diving into modding, you'll need to prepare your system. This involves downloading and installing the necessary NeoForge files.

The very first thing you'll want to do is download both the **client-server** and **client-only** installer files for NeoForge 21.1.174. You can find these on the official NeoForge website or a reputable mirror.

Once downloaded, you'll need to **install them on your computer**. The installation process typically involves running the `.jar` files you downloaded. For the client-only installer, this will set up a new Minecraft profile in your launcher. For the client-server installer, you'll use it to create a server environment.
