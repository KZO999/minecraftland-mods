### Helpful Guide for installing Mods in NeoForge

Locate Your mods Folder:

Open your Minecraft Launcher.
Go to the "Installations" tab.
Hover over your NeoForge 1.21.1 installation (it will likely be named something like neoforge-21.1.274).
Click on the folder icon that appears when you hover over the installation. This will open your Minecraft game directory.
Inside this directory, you should see a folder named mods. If you don't see one, create it (ensure the spelling is mods in lowercase).
Copy the Mod Files:

Drag and drop (or copy and paste) the .jar files of the mods you downloaded into the mods folder you just opened.
Launch Minecraft with NeoForge:

Close the mods folder and the Minecraft game directory.
Go back to your Minecraft Launcher.
Ensure you have selected your NeoForge 21.1.274 profile from the drop-down menu on the bottom left (or on the "Installations" tab, click "Play" next to your NeoForge installation).
Click "Play".
Verify Installation:

Once Minecraft loads, on the main menu, you should see a "Mods" button.
Clicking this button will show you a list of all installed mods. Your newly added mods should appear here.
Launch a single-player world (or join a multiplayer server running the same mods) to confirm the mods are working in-game.

You are ready for the action, join the minecraft server

Enjoy your modded Minecraft adventures!
